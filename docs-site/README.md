# Ameliorate Docs

## Setup

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

Note: for some reason, `npm run build` for subsequent builds runs into an issue: `Parsing of /home/keyserj/code/personal/ameliorate/docs-site/node_modules/nextra/dist/plugin.mjs for build dependencies failed at 'import(importPath)'`. Couldn't find a solution, but deleting your `docs-site/.next` directory and trying again should work.
