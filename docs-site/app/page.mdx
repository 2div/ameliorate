# Introduction

Welcome to the Ameliorate documentation!

## Where should I go next?

The documentation is split into an App section, which describes the tool itself (e.g. how to use, features, comparisons to other tools, etc.), and a Project section, which houses anything auxiliary to the app (e.g. discourse sessions, release status, etc.).
