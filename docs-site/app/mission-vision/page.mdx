# Mission & Vision

## Mission

Ameliorate's mission is to empower humanity to effectively solve problems by making it trivial to mutually understand the intricacies and perspectives involved.

## Vision

Imagine a world where:

- you never have to leave a conversation frustrated that you aren't understood, or that you can't understand someone else;
- politicians and citizens of diverse perspectives can work together and be satisfied with decisions intended to better society;
- when you hear about a tragedy in the world, you feel like _you can actually do something about it_.
