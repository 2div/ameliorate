# Pilot Testing

Ameliorate needs to be refined a lot if it's going to become good enough to achieve its [high-aiming vision](/mission-vision#vision), and more active & diverse feedback will help move it in the right direction more quickly. It would be immensely helpful if you would try to use Ameliorate and provide your thoughts on it!

The process for pilot testing is described below. It may take an hour or two, but you can go at your own pace. If you prefer to have more hands-on guidance, please [reach out](https://github.com/amelioro/ameliorate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reaching-out)! Ameliorate's maintainer is very happy to help, whether that be through answering questions over text, hopping on a call to walk you through it, or even facilitating group usage via something like a [Discourse Session](/discourse-sessions). You can also consider [joining a Discourse Session](/discourse-sessions#joining-a-session)!

  Pilot Testing is intended to be a relatively low-effort thing. If you're excited about the
  possibilities for a specific use case of yours, Ameliorate's maintainer would love to work with
  you and explore how Ameliorate could become exceptional for it! Feel free to [reach
  out](https://github.com/amelioro/ameliorate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reaching-out).

## Process

<Steps>

### Pick a topic

Ideally, you've got a problem in mind that you want to use Ameliorate to help you think through and/or align on with others! You may also be here without a specific idea. If that's the case, you can get inspiration from the [home page's list of examples](https://ameliorate.app/#examples) or from the [Topics for Discourse list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFpjLhtCBrUUOroZUmkj1oR5OZrxE1FsOtFxQnXyekk/edit).

### Build out the topic in Ameliorate

Head over to [Getting Started](/getting-started) to first learn how the app works, then take your topic and break it down. [Breakdown Process & Phases](/breakdown-process-phases) can be a good resource that provides direction with where to start diagramming and when to add each kind of node.

### Give feedback

Here is the most valuable part - take some time to think about how things went, and how they can become better. Please fill out the simple [Pilot Testing Feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEkj8ODJxfQ95Gm5Y1NibogtpG6AXiq_XZcdrNpIyouYVXXg/viewform).
