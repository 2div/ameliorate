# Release Status

A release status conveys an expectation of how solid the tool is, though there will
always be room for improvements and enhancements. These are the statuses:

**Alpha (current)**: tool is usable, core features exist but are unrefined, tool
may feel clunky to use, bugs are expected, no established userbase

**Beta**: core features are somewhat refined, tool does not feel clunky to use,
bugs are expected, established userbase is forming

**No label/fully-released**: core features are well-refined, tool feels smooth to
use, bugs are rare, established userbase exists
