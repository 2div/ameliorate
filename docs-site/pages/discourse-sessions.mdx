# Discourse Sessions

A discourse session is a session during which a small group discusses a chosen issue, using Ameliorate to reflect the discussion, keep it focused, and get people on the same page.

## Purpose

These sessions are a fun way to:

- improve understanding of the topic
- understand each others' perspectives on the topic
- see how Ameliorate can work
- consider how Ameliorate can be improved

## What does a session look like?

Sessions are expected to evolve as they're used more, but this is what they currently look like:

- Groups of 3-6
- 2 hours total: a few minutes at the beginning for introductions, ~75 minutes for discussion, and the rest of the time for reflecting on how things went
- Use the "Discourse Session" voice channel in the [Ameliorate Discord server](https://discord.gg/3KhdyJkTWT) to discuss with voice chat (facilitator will likely share video, but participants can do what they're comfortable with)
- Someone (probably the organizer) facilitates, i.e. shares their screen and builds an Ameliorate diagram as discussion progresses (screen sharing is necessary until [this](https://github.com/amelioro/ameliorate/issues/198) is done)
- Throughout discussion, breaks may be taken for participants to choose their own scores for the diagram (to quickly convey their opinions), or to research the topic for a few minutes

A Google Doc is typically used to guide the session - [here is the template doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_PH_l7rwyQPBrjONl3KK6HlyeVuGPKm8XWOM3Oh-z4/) for that.

### Past sessions

## Joining a session

We'd love to have you join a discourse session! In order to get in on the fun, you can join the [discourse mailing list](https://buttondown.email/ameliorate-discourse) to receive invites.

When a session is going to happen, an organizer will send an email with a poll for choosing the topic and time for the session - fill this out if you'd like to join. A follow-up email will be sent with the chosen topic and time.
