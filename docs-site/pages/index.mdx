# Introduction

Welcome to the Ameliorate documentation!

## What is Ameliorate?

Ameliorate is a tool for discussing and mutually understanding tough problems.

It provides a standard, precise way of representing all information relevant to solving a problem, along with efficient ways to understand, discuss, and improve that information.

## Where should I go next?

The documentation is split into an App section, which describes the tool itself (e.g. how to use, features, comparisons to other tools, etc.), and a Project section, which houses anything auxiliary to the app (e.g. discourse sessions, release status, etc.).
