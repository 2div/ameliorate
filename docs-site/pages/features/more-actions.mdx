At any time, you can download your Topic as a JSON file. This can be particularly useful if you're interacting with your Topic on the Playground and want to work on another Topic in the Playground without losing your data, or if you want to share it with others.

If you have a Topic file, you can upload it to the Playground or to a User Topic, and the Workspace will be populated with the data from the file.
