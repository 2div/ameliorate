Views and filters help you look at different aspects of your Topic.

## Views

### Criteria Table

## Filters

Filters are especially useful when your diagram gets big, like this (you can follow along with this topic [here](https://ameliorate.app/examples/climate-change)):

  width={2560}
  height={1440}
/>

You can find the filter options in the Views tab of the Topic Pane:

  height={733}
/>

### General Filter Options

There are a few general options:

- Choose which node types to display (e.g. only Problem and Solution nodes)

- Show only nodes that have scores within a specified range (this also works to filter the Criteria Table)

- Show “Secondary Neighbors”, e.g. show relevant Questions in the Topic Diagram, show relevant Problems in the Research Diagram (renamed from “Explore Diagram”)

### Standard Filters

Standard Filters are predefined filters based on the node types in the Topic.

#### Structure Filters

These filters are only available for filtering structural nodes

##### High-level Filter

Show only immediate causes, effects, and solutions of the problem(s):

  height={1440}
/>

##### Problem Filter

For a problem, show all causes and/or effects and/or criteria and/or solutions:

  height={1440}
/>

##### Tradeoffs Filter

Show selected criteria and/or solutions, with or without their details (effects/components) (this also works to filter the Criteria Table)
